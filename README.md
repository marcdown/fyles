IPFS-backed smart contract public filestore with support for Proof of Existence.

## About
fyles is a web3-powered dApp that allows you to easily upload files to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), a p2p distributed file system. The file hash is then stored in a smart contract associated with your wallet address, providing access to all of your files. This process allows for Proof of Existence, effectively proving the file existed at a certain point in time by attaching the same file hash to a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.

You can read more about IPFS [here](https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f) and the concept of PoE [here](https://www.newsbtc.com/proof-of-existence).

## Usage
fyles works on any Web3-enabled browser! This could be Chrome Desktop with [MetaMask extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), Firefox Android with [MetaMask add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ether-metamask) and even native mobile dApp browsers like [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.toshi.org) and [Cipher](https://www.cipherbrowser.com)!

You can take fyles for a spin on the [Rinkeby testnet](https://www.rinkeby.io) by going to https://rinkeby.fyles.io.
